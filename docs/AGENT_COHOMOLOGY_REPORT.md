# Agent H Report — Cohomology Integrals / Pairings

## Scope
- `Hodge/Analytic/Integration/PairingConnection.lean`
- `Hodge/Analytic/Integration/StokesTheorem.lean`

## Findings (to fill)
- Remaining stub‑style definitions:
  - None on the proof‑track; zero stubs have been replaced by explicit data interfaces.
- Data interfaces added:
  - `CohomologyPairingData` (pairing on cohomology classes).
  - `CohomologyIntegralData` (top‑degree cohomology integral).

## Risks / Notes
- These interfaces still require real Stokes/Poincaré duality to be constructed.

## Next steps
- Provide genuine constructions once Stokes and integration compatibility are proven.
