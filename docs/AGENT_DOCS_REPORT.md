# Agent I Report — Deep‑Track Doc Alignment

## Scope
- `Hodge/Deep/*.lean`
- `docs/DEEP_TASK_INDEX.md`
- `docs/UNCONDITIONAL_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`

## Findings (to fill)
- Stale references to `SubmanifoldIntegration.universal/real`:
  - `docs/AGENT_PLAYBOOK_FULL_UNCONDITIONAL.md` (historical wording)
  - `docs/PROOF_TRACK_STATUS.md` (historical wording)
  - `docs/SEMANTIC_GOTCHAS_INDEX.md` (historical wording)
  - `docs/PROOF_COMPLETION_PLAN_FULL_UNCONDITIONAL.md` (already clarified to data‑first)

## Risks / Notes
- Some references are intentional historical notes; only adjust if they mislead new contributors.

## Next steps
- Decide whether to standardize wording to “data‑first SubmanifoldIntegrationData” everywhere.
