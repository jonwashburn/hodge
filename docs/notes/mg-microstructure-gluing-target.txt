MICROSTRUCTURE/GLUING (OPTION B)
Target Theorem + Lemma Dependency DAG (execution roadmap)
Repository: hodge
Generated: 2025-12-14

Purpose
-------
This file is a single “roadmap section” for making the manuscript’s microstructure/gluing step
fully unconditional, executable lemma-by-lemma without losing the thread.

It is written in classical math language and points to existing labeled results in:
  - hodge-SAVE-dec-12-handoff.tex

High-level diagnosis
--------------------
The paper’s reduction hinges on the ability to construct a global raw current T^raw from local
calibrated holomorphic pieces so that:
  (a) T^raw approximates mβ locally (Young-measure / tangential sense), and
  (b) F(∂T^raw) = o(m).

The existing manuscript contains many “plumbing” lemmas for flat-norm bookkeeping and rounding.
What remains (Option B) is the genuinely geometric/analytic manufacturing of holomorphic slivers
with a corner-exit footprint that enforces face-level O(h) edit control.


============================================================
0) STANDALONE TARGET THEOREM (what must be proved)
============================================================

T0. Microstructure/Gluing Theorem (Standalone)
----------------------------------------------
Let (X,ω) be smooth projective Kähler, ψ := ω^{n-p}/(n-p)!.
Let β be a smooth closed cone-valued (p,p)-form representing an effective rational Hodge class [γ^+].
Let m ≫ 1 clear denominators so PD(m[γ^+]) is integral.

Choose a mesh-h decomposition of X into coordinate cells {Q} (in holomorphic charts), with h→0 as m→∞.
Construct ψ-calibrated holomorphic complete-intersection pieces {Y^{Q,a}} and define the raw integral
current:
  T^raw := Σ_Q Σ_a [Y^{Q,a}]⟂Q

such that:
  (T0.i) Local approximation: T^raw approximates mβ cellwise in the tangential/Young-measure sense
         used in the manuscript’s “local sheets” step.
  (T0.ii) Flat boundary smallness:  F(∂T^raw) = o(m)  in the joint limit (m→∞, h→0, ε→0, …).

Equivalently: there exists a correction current R_glue with ∂R_glue = -∂T^raw and Mass(R_glue)=o(m),
so that T := T^raw + R_glue is a closed ψ-calibrated integral cycle in PD(m[γ^+]).

Where this is used in the manuscript
------------------------------------
- The missing link is identified in Remark rem:glue-gap (flat norm / mismatch control).
- A sufficient “activation package” is Theorem thm:sliver-mass-matching-on-template, which reduces
  F(∂T^raw)=o(m) to two core inputs: local realizability on a fixed template (iii) and O(h) face edits (iv).


============================================================
1) WHAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE (do not redo)
============================================================

DONE-A. Flat-norm gluing / bookkeeping machinery (existing in the manuscript)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are the “pipes” that convert per-face mismatch into a global flat-norm bound:
  - prop:prefix-template-coherence  (per-face mismatch bound from displacement + edits)
  - lem:template-displacement, lem:template-displacement-edits, lem:template-edits-oh
  - prop:transport-flat-glue-weighted  (weighted/robust flat-glue estimate)
  - cor:global-flat-weighted  (global sum over faces)
  - lem:uniformly-convex-slice-boundary (boundary-volume scaling in smooth convex cells)

DONE-B. Global direction labeling and rounding (existing in the manuscript)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - lem:lipschitz-qp-weights (stable direction labels + Lipschitz weights)
  - lem:slow-variation-rounding, lem:slow-variation-discrepancy (slow variation after rounding)
  - cohomology rounding via Bárány–Grinberg (lem:barany-grinberg and subsequent proposition)

DONE-C. Checkerboard / vertex-template combinatorics (existing in the manuscript)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These convert slow variation of counts into O(h) fractional tail edits *if* local geometry supplies
two facts (G1-iff and G2).
  - def:checkerboard-anchoring
  - def:block-uniform-codes
  - lem:prefix-discrepancy
  - lem:two-sided-face-pop
  - prop:checkerboard-face-oh-edit   (now unconditional once the holomorphic corner-exit package supplies (G1-iff)/(G2); see cor:corner-exit-iii-iv)


============================================================
2) OPTION B CORE IDEA (what we will prove)
============================================================

With checkerboard/prefix-balancing in place, item (iv) reduces to two purely local geometric facts:

  (G1-iff) “Face incidence is exactly the designated exit-face set.”
     - Ball containment gives “only-if”: cannot reach nonincident faces.
     - Corner-exit simplex structure gives “if”: sliver hits each designated exit face in (k−1)-patch.

  (G2) “Uniform per-face boundary mass comparability.”
     - In the fat corner-simplex model: each designated facet has (k−1)-mass ≍ v^{(k−1)/k}.
     - Small-slope holomorphic graph multiplies by (1+O(ε^2)).

So Option B reduces to:
  “Manufacture holomorphic slivers whose footprint in each cell is a uniformly fat corner simplex
   supported near an assigned vertex, with uniform constants across the atlas.”

Summary (short)
---------------
As of Dec 2025, the master manuscript contains a complete corner-exit / vertex-template route that supplies the remaining microstructure/gluing input:
L1 (holomorphic corner-exit manufacturing), L2 (prefix mass-budget rounding), and the all-label global coherence packaging (B1),
hence yields F(∂T^raw)=o(m) and the small correction current, closing T0.


============================================================
4) EXECUTION PLAN (proof tasks per OPEN/NEW node)
============================================================

 L1.1 [DONE] Corner-exit template planes (flat/complex model)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: In a fixed cube Q=[0,h]^d and vertex v, construct a family of affine k-planes
P_{v,a} = P + v + t_{v,a} such that:
  - P_{v,a}∩Q ⊂ B(v,c0 h)
  - P_{v,a}∩Q is a k-simplex with k+1 facets lying in a fixed set of k+1 coordinate faces through v
  - “fatness” (biLipschitz to Δ_{s,b} with b_i∈[Λ^{-1},Λ]) is uniform in a
  - slice k-volume is equal or uniformly comparable across a
  - transverse parameters t_{v,a} are δ-separated (for later disjointness)

Status note: The manuscript now contains (i) a fully explicit complex example (lem:complex-corner-exit-template),
(ii) a quantitative open-family template lemma (lem:corner-exit-template-open), and
(iii) the robust finite-net supply statement needed for B1 (prop:corner-exit-template-net).

Deliverable: a Definition “corner-exit template plane family” + proof that the admissible parameter region
in P^⊥ has positive measure so one can pick an infinite δ-separated ordered list (with uniform fatness constants).


L1.3 + L1.4 [DONE] Local geometric lemmas (corner-exit ⇒ (G1-iff) and (G2))
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Prove the exact local facts needed by prop:checkerboard-face-oh-edit:
  - Ball containment excludes nonincident faces (only-if)
  - Fat corner-simplex footprint hits each designated exit face in positive (k−1)-mass patch (if)
  - Fatness ⇒ each designated facet has (k−1)-mass comparable to v^{(k−1)/k}
  - Small-slope C^1 graphs preserve these properties up to (1+O(ε^2))

Done in manuscript:
  - lem:ball-excludes-faces
  - lem:corner-simplex-hits-designated-faces
  - lem:corner-simplex-face-mass
  - lem:small-graph-distortion
  - prop:holomorphic-corner-exit-g1g2
  - cor:holomorphic-corner-exit-inherits


L1 [DONE] Holomorphic corner-exit sliver theorem (local manufacturing)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal (informal): given a corner-exit affine plane P_{v,a} in a holomorphic chart, produce a ψ-calibrated
holomorphic complete intersection Y_{v,a} so that Y_{v,a}∩Q is a C^1 graph over P_{v,a}∩Q with slope ≤ε,
and the footprint geometry (exit-face set + fatness) is preserved.

Subtasks:
  - Use lem:bergman-control to prescribe jets (s_i(x_a)=0, ds_i≈λ_i) with uniform C^1 control on a ball
    containing Q (Bergman scale h≲m^{-1/2}).
  - Use lem:graph-from-grad to get a graph over Π on (a domain containing Q).
  - Ensure the graph domain includes all of Q with uniform constants (choose Q inside that Bergman ball).
  - Combine with the corner-exit plane footprint + small slope to deduce (G1-iff) and (G2).
  - Use δ-separation of transverse parameters + lem:sliver-stability(ii) to ensure disjointness.

Deliverable: now in manuscript as prop:holomorphic-corner-exit-L1 (plus cor:holomorphic-corner-exit-inherits and rem:vertex-star-coherence).

Critical technical checkpoint:
  - You must formulate the graph result at the right scale so it applies on the entire cell Q, not just
    an infinitesimal neighborhood. (This is where Bergman/peak-section input must do real work.)


L2 [DONE] Mass budget matching in the corner-exit regime (cellwise)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: For each cell Q, with target mass budget M_Q (derived from mβ) and a chosen vertex split M_{Q,v},
choose counts N_{Q,v} and a prefix of slivers at each vertex such that:
  Σ_{v∈Vert(Q)} Σ_{a≤N_{Q,v}} Mass([Y_{Q,v,a}]⟂Q) = M_Q + o(M_Q)
and each vertex family is realized by the same ordered global vertex template.

Subtasks:
  - Ensure per-sliver masses are equal/comparable across template indices (so rounding works cleanly).
  - Prove a corner-exit analogue of prop:prefix-activation-flat-ball / cor:prefix-activation-holo:
    prefix length N determines total mass up to one-piece error; relative error is O(1/N)+O(ε^2).
  - Use existing rounding lemmas (slow variation) to choose N_{Q,v} with |N_{Q,v}-N_{Q',v}|≤Ch min(...) for adjacent cells.

Deliverable: now in manuscript as prop:vertex-template-mass-matching and cor:corner-exit-iii-iv.


T2 (iv) [DONE] Turn local corner-exit geometry into global face O(h) edits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once L1 supplies (G1-iff) and (G2) for the actual holomorphic slivers, prop:checkerboard-face-oh-edit
becomes unconditional: unmatched face mass is an O(h) fraction of total face mass.

Deliverable: now recorded in the master via cor:corner-exit-iii-iv together with prop:checkerboard-face-oh-edit / prop:vertex-template-face-edits.


T0 completion [DONE] Conclude F(∂T^raw)=o(m) and produce the correction current
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With (iii) local realizability + (iv) face O(h) edits in hand, the existing bookkeeping machinery yields:
  - per-face flat mismatch bounds,
  - global weighted flat-norm bound,
  - F(∂T^raw)=o(m) under the parameter regime,
  - existence of correction current R_glue with Mass(R_glue)=o(m),
  - closed calibrated cycle in PD(m[γ^+]).

Deliverable: now captured in the master by rem:glue-gap (rewritten as “Microstructure/gluing estimate (now established)”) and thm:automatic-syr.


============================================================
5) PARAMETER REGIME CHECKLIST (avoid hidden contradictions)
============================================================

Before finalizing proofs, lock a coherent scaling regime that satisfies all constraints simultaneously:
  - Bergman control on cell:  h ≲ m^{-1/2}
  - Many pieces per relevant cell: N_Q ≳ h^{-1} (or whatever threshold your flat-glue estimate needs)
  - Small-angle/slope: ε = ε(h) → 0
  - Disjointness: transverse separation δ ≳ ε h
  - Global error: the bound from cor:global-flat-weighted must be o(m)

This should be recorded as a single “Parameter regime” lemma/remark that every later estimate cites.


============================================================
6) RS → classical translation (one sentence)
============================================================

Recognition Science view: the missing theorem is “ledger closure under synchronized discrete events.”
Classical math view: work at the finite resolution scale h~m^{-1/2} (Bergman scale), construct calibrated holomorphic “events” that are uniformly C^1-close
to a linear model on a Bergman ball (so each is a single sheet on a whole cell), and then use corner-exit + checkerboard/prefix bookkeeping to make the
inter-cell mismatch have vanishing flat norm, so the global current is closed up to o(m).
