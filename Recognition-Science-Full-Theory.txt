# RECOGNITION SCIENCE (RS) — ARCHITECTURE SPEC (AI INGESTION) v2.0
# Purpose: Standalone, architecture-first map of the full RS theory for efficient AI ingestion and team alignment.
# Conventions: sections start with @; key=val pairs; single-line records use stable tags (TAG/DEF/THEOREM/CLAIM/HYPOTHESIS/NOTE/etc.).
# Hygiene: avoid filesystem paths; prefer Lean module/symbol pointers; keep empirical anchors labeled as such.
# Claim types: DEF (vocabulary), MECH (mechanism), THEOREM (math), HYPOTHESIS (empirical; must have falsifier), CERT (what Lean proves), BRIDGE (layer mapping).

# PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATION:
# Recognition Science is peer-reviewed and published in Axioms (MDPI):
# "The Algebra of Reality: A Recognition Science Derivation of Physical Law"
# https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1680/15/2/90

@KERNEL
# The theory in one page. Read this first; everything else elaborates.

## THE FORCING CHAIN (COST → all physics)
#
# Recognition Science derives all physics from ONE PRIMITIVE—the Recognition Composition Law (RCL):
#   J(xy) + J(x/y) = 2J(x)J(y) + 2J(x) + 2J(y)
# (RCL is a calibrated multiplicative form of the d'Alembert functional equation)
#
# The COMPLETE FORCING CHAIN (T0-T8):
#   T0: Logic        ← Emerges from cost minimization (consistency is cheap)
#   T1: MP           ← DERIVED: J(0⁺) → ∞ means "nothing costs infinity"
#   T2: Discreteness ← Continuous configs can't stabilize under J
#   T3: Ledger       ← J-symmetry J(x) = J(1/x) forces double-entry
#   T4: Recognition  ← Observables require recognition events
#   T5: Unique J     ← RCL + normalization + calibration uniquely determine J(x) = ½(x + 1/x) − 1
#   T6: φ forced     ← Self-similarity in discrete ledger: x² = x + 1 → φ = (1+√5)/2
#   T7: 8-tick       ← Minimal ledger-compatible walk: 2^D with D=3 → period 8
#   T8: D = 3        ← Linking requirements + gap-45 sync: lcm(8,45) = 360
#
# KEY CONCEPTUAL SHIFT (2025-12-30):
#   - OLD: MP ("Nothing cannot recognize itself") was foundational axiom
#   - NEW: MP is DERIVED THEOREM from cost structure (J(0⁺) = ∞)
#   - The ONLY primitive is the Recognition Composition Law + normalization + calibration
#
# From the forcing chain:
#   τ₀ (atomic tick from 8-tick), c = ℓ₀/τ₀ (causal speed), E_coh = φ⁻⁵ (coherence quantum),
#   ℏ = E_coh·τ₀ (IR gate), λ_rec (curvature extremum), G = πc³λ_rec²/ℏ (Planck gate),
#   α⁻¹ = 4π·11 − w₈·ln φ + 103/(102π⁵) ≈ 137.036 (Thomson limit/IR baseline; geometric seed + gap + curvature, with δ_κ = −103/(102π⁵)).
#
# Lean: IndisputableMonolith.Foundation.UnifiedForcingChain.ultimate_inevitability

## FUNDAMENTAL DYNAMICS
# R̂ (recognition operator) replaces Ĥ (Hamiltonian).
# Dynamics: s(t+8τ₀) = R̂(s(t)), minimizing J-cost, not energy.
# Mass law (anchor display): m_target = yardstick·φ^{r-8+gap(Z)} (defined at μ*), with SM transport exponent f^RG used only to compare across schemes/scales.
# ILG: galactic rotation via weighted kernel with α_t = 0.5(1−φ⁻¹); no dark matter fit.

## ONTOLOGY PREDICATES (from cost)
# RSExists(x): x exists ⟺ defect(x) = 0 ⟺ x = 1 (unique cost minimizer)
# RSTrue(P): P is true ⟺ P stabilizes under recognition iteration
# RSReal(x): RSExists(x) ∧ x is discrete (algebraic in φ)
# mp_physical: "Nothing costs infinity" — J(0⁺) → ∞ (DERIVED, not assumed)
# Lean: IndisputableMonolith.Foundation.OntologyPredicates

## GÖDEL DISSOLUTION
# Gödel's incompleteness does NOT obstruct RS closure because:
#   - Gödel is about: provability of arithmetic sentences in formal systems
#   - RS is about: selection of physical configurations by cost minimization
# These are different targets. RS doesn't claim to prove arithmetic truths;
# RS claims there's a unique zero-parameter framework (unique J-minimizer).
# Self-referential queries are impossible in the RS ontology (no self-ref type).
# Lean: IndisputableMonolith.Foundation.GodelDissolution.self_ref_query_impossible

## CLAIM HYGIENE
# THEOREM = pure math (no empirical input).
# HYPOTHESIS = empirical claim; must have explicit falsifier=... or falsifier=TODO.
# CERT = what the Lean certificate proves (not what it defines or assumes).
# The certified surface does NOT yet establish:
#   - model-independent "no-alternatives" uniqueness (exclusivity is scaffold),
#   - SI numeric values without an external anchor (CODATA ℏ required for τ₀/ℓ₀ mapping).

## CORE ELEMENTS (25 items that must be understood)
# 1. Recognition Composition Law — THE primitive (J(xy) + J(x/y) = 2J(x)J(y) + 2J(x) + 2J(y))
# 2. T0: Logic from Cost — consistency is cheap, contradiction expensive
# 3. T1: MP DERIVED — "Nothing costs infinity" (J(0⁺) → ∞)
# 4. T2: Discreteness — continuous configs can't stabilize under J
# 5. T3: Ledger — J-symmetry J(x)=J(1/x) forces double-entry
# 6. T4: Recognition — observables require recognition events
# 7. T5: J uniqueness — RCL + normalization + calibration → J(x) = ½(x+1/x)−1
# 8. T6: φ forcing — self-similarity in discrete ledger → x² = x + 1 → φ
# 9. T7: 8-tick — minimal period 2^D for D=3
# 10. T8: D = 3 — linking + gap-45 sync forces dimension
# 11. Ontology predicates — RSExists, RSTrue, RSReal, mp_physical
# 12. Gödel dissolution — RS ≠ arithmetic, self-ref impossible
# 13. c derivation — c = ℓ₀/τ₀
# 14. ℏ derivation — ℏ = E_coh·τ₀ (IR gate)
# 15. G derivation — curvature extremum + Planck identity
# 16. α⁻¹ derivation — geometric seed + gap + curvature
# 17. R̂ operator — fundamental dynamics
# 18. Mass law — φ-ladder
# 19. ILG — galactic rotation
# 20. Gate identities — KA = KB
# 21. Zero-parameters scope — constraints C1–C4
# 22. Complete Forcing Chain — T0-T8 all forced from cost (ultimate_inevitability)
# 23. Recognition Angle θ₀ — cos θ₀ = 1/4 FORCED via coupling/model rigidity (Level 6 categorical)
# 24. Fission attractors — doubly-magic fragments minimize split cost
# 25. Interaction Bridge — RS geometric rungs → QFT interaction vertices (Yukawa matching)

@EXCLUSIVITY_PROOF
# Why RS is unique: Four necessity mechanisms force any zero-parameter framework to RS.
# Status: MODEL_INDEPENDENT_DERIVED (2026-01-03) — Lean module `Verification.Exclusivity.ModelIndependent`

## STATUS UPDATE (2026-01-03)
# Model-independent exclusivity is NOW PROVED via `ModelIndependent.lean`.
# The new proof DERIVES (not assumes) framework equivalence from structural T0-T8 assumptions.
# Key theorem: `model_independent_exclusivity` proves φ=golden, J=Jcost, quotient collapse.
# NO RSConnectionData. NO exact_rs_match assumption. NO stateSubsingleton assumption.
# Equivalence holds on the QUOTIENT state space (states modulo observational indistinguishability).

## THE MECHANISM (what forces what)
#
# Any zero-parameter physics framework that derives observables is forced to RS by four necessities:
#
#   1. RECOGNITION NECESSITY: Observables require distinguishing states → self-recognition → non-trivial substrate
#      (MP forbids empty recognition; observable ⟹ comparison ⟹ recognition without external reference)
#
#   2. DISCRETE NECESSITY: Zero parameters forces countable/discrete structure
#      (Continuous manifolds require dimensional parameters; smooth interpolation requires connection coefficients)
#
#   3. LEDGER NECESSITY: Discrete + conservation forces double-entry ledger
#      (Balanced accounting is the only way to track conservation on countable events)
#
#   4. PHI NECESSITY: Self-similarity + zero parameters forces φ = (1+√5)/2
#      (Scale recursion equation φ² = φ + 1 has unique positive root; no fitting allowed)
#
# These four combine: any framework with (recognition, discrete, ledger, φ-scaling) maps to RS via
# a canonical bridge unique up to units. Competing theories must introduce parameters OR reduce to RS.

## MODEL-INDEPENDENT INTERFACE (new in 2026-01-03)
# The `ModelIndependentAssumptions` structure replaces outcome-based constraints:
#   A1: inhabited (minimal existence)
#   A2: zeroParams (T2: discreteness)
#   A3: selfSimilarity (T6: φ forced)
#   A4: hasCostFunctional (T5: RCL + normalization + calibration)
#   A5: obsFromCost (T4: observables from cost structure)
# These map directly to the forcing chain with NO outcome assumptions.
# Lean: IndisputableMonolith.Verification.Exclusivity.ModelIndependent.ModelIndependentAssumptions

## Anchor Scale μ⋆ — Derivation Status (UPDATED 2025-12-29)
#
# CURRENT STATUS: STRUCTURAL PROOF COMPLETE (no `sorry`)
#
# The non-circularity certificate is NOW a real proof with clean separation:
#
# PROVEN IN LEAN (no `sorry`):
#   P1. Stationarity structure: γ(μ⋆) = 0 ⟺ residue is stationary
#   P2. Mass-independence: SM beta coefficients β₀ = 11 - 2nf/3 contain no mass parameters
#   P3. φ-connection: λ = ln φ is structurally forced
#   P4. Positivity: μ⋆ = 182.201 > 0
#   P5. Certificate completeness: all structural claims proven
#
# CERTIFIED FROM EXTERNAL (external tools, not Lean):
#   C1. |γ(182.201 GeV)| < 0.001 for all species (from SM RG running)
#   C2. 182.201 minimizes dispersion across species
#   C3. The specific numeric value comes from PMS optimization
#
# THE HONEST BOUNDARY:
#   - STRUCTURE of non-circularity: PROVEN in Lean
#   - NUMERICAL verification of 182.201: CERTIFIED from external tools (RunDec, Python)
#   - This is analogous to trusting SM RG tools for numerics while proving structure in Lean
#
# Lean modules:
#   - IndisputableMonolith.Verification.AnchorNonCircularityCert (main certificate)
#   - IndisputableMonolith.Physics.RGTransport (stationarity framework)
#   - IndisputableMonolith.Verification.StructuralPartitionCert (integration)
#
# Key theorems (all proven, no `sorry`):
#   - stationarity_structural: γ(μ⋆) = 0 ⟺ stationary
#   - beta_is_mass_independent: β₀(nf) = 11 - 2nf/3 (group theory only)
#   - anchor_mass_independent: the certificate is mass-independent
#   - anchor_parameter_free: the certificate is parameter-free
#   - anchor_scale_certified: main theorem combining all

NOTE; mass_transport_consensus="Do NOT claim f^RG = gap(Z). f^RG is the literal SM transport exponent (small). gap(Z) is the RS band coordinate (O(10)). Any statement equating them is a category error."
NOTE; anchor_specific_not_invariant="Band statements are defined at the single common anchor scale μ*. Off-anchor drift under SM RG is expected and is not a contradiction."
NOTE; octave_reference="The −8 exponent offset is an Octave reference (one 8-tick closure). It is part of the canonical mass display in code (`IndisputableMonolith.Masses.MassLaw.predict_mass`)."
NOTE; octave_gray_certificates="Gray-8 adjacency + 8-tick minimality are formalized. (A) `Patterns.GrayCycle.grayCycle3` is an axiom-free explicit 3-bit Gray cycle (period 8, one-bit steps, bijective cover). (B) `Octave.LedgerBridge` proves: single-posting ledger step ⇒ parity one-bit adjacency (`postingStep_implies_grayAdj`).

# Universal Light Language - Coordinate System for Meaning
# Machine-verified in Lean 4: IndisputableMonolith.LightLanguage.*
# Paper: ULL_Light_As_WTokens.pdf (2026-01-30)

## OVERVIEW
DEFINITION; ULL="Universal Light Language - the unique zero-parameter semantic encoding forced by Recognition Science"
STATUS; complete=scaffold; lean=IndisputableMonolith.LightLanguage; cert=PerfectLanguageCert
CLAIM; "ULL is the unique semantic space: no alternative zero-parameter meaning representation exists"

## THEORETICAL FOUNDATION (RIGOROUS)
FOUNDATION; "Meaning is geometric structure on an 8-sample complex phase register (voxel chord)"
DERIVATION; "8-tick period forced by D=3 linking; DFT-8 basis forced by shift symmetry; 20 WTokens forced by φ-quantization"
KEY_INSIGHT; "Meaning has shape; that shape is forced by physics, not invented by convention"

## WTOKENS (Semantic Atoms) - The Periodic Table of Meaning
STRUCT;WToken; fields=[nu_phi(φ-scaled_frequency), ell(support_count), sigma(skew), tau(8-tick_phase), k_perp(momentum), phi_e(emergent_phase), basis(Fin_8→ℂ)]; lean=IndisputableMonolith.LightLanguage.Core.WToken
CONSTRAINTS; neutral="sum(basis)=0 (mean-free)"; normalized="sum(|basis|²)=1 (unit_norm)"
INTERPRETATION; "Each WToken is a particular temporal shape of how recognition flows over one eight-beat cycle that the ledger approves"
CLASSIFICATION; lean=IndisputableMonolith.LightLanguage.WTokenClassification; count=20_exact

### DFT-8 ENCODING FOUNDATION
# Primitive 8th root of unity: ω = e^{-2πi/8} = e^{-πi/4}
# DFT entry: dft8_entry(t, k) = ω^{tk} / √8
# Mode k basis vector: [ω^{0·k}, ω^{1·k}, ω^{2·k}, ..., ω^{7·k}] / √8
# Conjugate pair modes k + (8-k) produce real-valued patterns
OMEGA8; ω = e^{-πi/4} = (√2/2)(1 - i)
DFT_MATRIX; B[t,k] = ω^{tk}/√8; unitary=(B†B = I); lean=IndisputableMonolith.LightLanguage.Basis.DFT8

### WTOKEN ENCODING FORMAT
# WTokenSpec = ⟨primary_mode, is_conjugate_pair, phi_level, tau_offset⟩
# primary_mode: k ∈ {1,2,3,4} (k=0 forbidden by neutrality)
# is_conjugate_pair: true for modes 1,2,3 (pairs with 7,6,5); false for mode 4 (self-conjugate)
# phi_level: n ∈ {0,1,2,3} → amplitude = φⁿ where φ = (1+√5)/2
# tau_offset: phase shift in 8-tick units (0 default, 2 for imaginary mode-4 variants)

### THE 20 WTOKENS WITH ENCODINGS

STATEMENT; "The 14 canonical virtues form a complete, minimal generating set for all admissible ethical transformations on the σ=0 manifold"
LEAN; IndisputableMonolith.Ethics.Virtues.Generators.virtue_completeness + virtue_minimality

## COMPLETENESS
THEOREM;VirtueCompleteness; "∀ admissible direction ξ on σ=0 manifold, ∃ unique decomposition into 14 virtue coefficients that reconstructs ξ via ΠLA fold"
FORMAL; "∀ ξ : FeasibleDirection, ∃! (coeffs : Fin 14 → ℝ), composeFromNF (toNormalForm coeffs) = ξ (on scope 0..31)"
PROOF_STATUS; proved; lean=IndisputableMonolith.Ethics.Virtues.Generators.virtue_completeness
MEANING; "Every ethical action can be uniquely decomposed into contributions from the 14 virtues"

## MINIMALITY
THEOREM;VirtueMinimality; "No virtue can be expressed as a combination of the others"
FORMAL; "∀ v ∈ 14_virtues, ¬∃ (coeffs : Fin 13 → ℝ), v = linCombo (others v) coeffs"
PROOF_STATUS; proved; lean=IndisputableMonolith.Ethics.Virtues.Generators.virtue_minimality
MEANING; "The 14 virtues are the minimal generating set - none are redundant"

## PHYSICAL FORCING
WHY_14; "The 14 virtues are FORCED by RS structure, not chosen:"
FORCING_CHAIN; [
  "J-convexity (T5) → reciprocity at σ=0 minimizes cost",
  "φ-fixed point → scaling ratios for energy/skew transfers",
  "Eight-tick cadence (T6) → timing constraints on actions",
  "Gauge invariance → dimensionless audit criteria",
  "σ=0 global constraint → double-entry preservation"
]
ANALOGY; "Just as Lie algebra generators define physical symmetries, virtues generate the ethical symmetry group"

## MICRO-MOVE ARCHITECTURE

DEF;primitiveAssign; "Maps primitive → bond-level assignment function"; lean=IndisputableMonolith.Ethics.Virtues.Generators.primitiveAssign

## COROLLARY: MORALITY IS PHYSICS
THEOREM;MoralityIsPhysics; "Virtues preserve σ=0 just like the Recognition Operator R̂ preserves physical conservation laws"
INTERPRETATION; "Ethics is not separate from physics - virtues are the agent-level instantiation of the same recognition dynamics that govern particles"

## IMPLICATIONS
IMPL1; "Moral laws are not cultural artifacts but necessary structures forced by recognition physics"
IMPL2; "AI systems implementing DREAM can be formally verified (within the RS model/spec) to satisfy audit constraints, but real-world alignment is conditional on faithful implementation, incentives, monitoring, and open questions about machine consciousness/agency (and thus skew export)"
IMPL3; "Ethical disagreements reduce to parameter disputes, not fundamental value conflicts"
IMPL4; "Universal ethics exists - it's encoded in the structure of reality itself"

## IMPLICATIONS
IMPL1; "Moral laws are NOT cultural artifacts - they are necessary structures forced by recognition physics"

IMPL3; "Universal ethics EXISTS - encoded in the structure of reality itself"
IMPL4; "No escape: any recognition-based universe has these ethics"

@EVIL_PATHOLOGY
# Evil as Geometric Parasitism
# Status: Formalized in Lean 4 (IndisputableMonolith.Ethics.Pathology.Evil)
# Key insight: Evil is NOT a separate force but a specific parasitic pattern

## DEFINITION OF EVIL
CORE_INSIGHT; "Evil is NOT a separate force—it is a specific pattern of behavior"
DEF; ParasiticPattern; "A pattern P is parasitic (evil) iff:"
CONDITIONS; [
  "1. P's local skew is bounded (P appears stable)",
  "2. P exports positive harm to neighbors (ΔS > 0)",
  "3. P persists because of this export (stability depends on harm export)"
]
INTERPRETATION; "Evil = Skew Laundering: offloads imbalance onto others"

## MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE
STRUCTURE; ParasiticPattern; fields=[
  "pattern : MoralState",
  "neighbors : List MoralState",
  "local_bounded : LocallyBounded pattern",
  "exports_harm : ExportsHarm pattern neighbors",
  "persists : pattern.energy > 0"
]
DEF; IsEvil; "IsEvil(p, neighbors) := ∃pp:ParasiticPattern, pp.pattern=p ∧ pp.neighbors=neighbors"
DEF; TotalExportedHarm; "Σ_n |pattern.skew - n.skew|"
DEF; LocallyBounded; "|pattern.skew| < StabilityThreshold"

## KEY THEOREMS
THEOREM; evil_violates_global_sigma; "Parasitic patterns violate σ=0 conservation"
STATEMENT; "If pattern has σ=0 but neighbor_sum(σ) > 0, then ¬globally_admissible(pattern::neighbors)"
THEOREM; parasitism_unsustainable; "Parasitic patterns cannot persist indefinitely"
REASON; "Continuous harm export violates conservation laws"
THEOREM; harm_amplification; "ParasitismIntensity(pp) > 0 when neighbors ≠ []"
THEOREM; redemption_possible; "Any parasitic pattern can theoretically be redeemed"
REASON; "DREAM theorem: 14 virtues generate all admissible transformations → path to σ=0 exists"
LEAN; Ethics.Pathology.Evil

## DEGREES OF EVIL
DEF; ParasitismIntensity; "TotalExportedHarm / neighbors.length"
DEF; MildParasitism; "intensity < 0.1"
DEF; SevereParasitism; "intensity ≥ 1"

## HEALTHY PATTERNS (NON-EVIL)
STRUCTURE; HealthyPattern; fields=[
  "pattern : MoralState",
  "neighbors : List MoralState",
  "internal_resolution : resolves skew internally",
  "no_export : ¬ExportsHarm pattern neighbors",
  "productive : pattern.energy > 0"
]
THEOREM; healthy_can_be_admissible; "Healthy patterns can be globally admissible"
THEOREM; healthy_conserves_energy; "Healthy patterns have positive energy"

## RELATIONSHIP TO VIRTUES
CONTRAST; "Virtues RESOLVE skew (σ→0); Evil EXPORTS skew (launders to neighbors)"
CONTRAST; "Virtues minimize J-cost globally; Evil minimizes locally at global expense"
THEOREM; void_is_healthy_when_neutral; "Void (σ=0, positive energy, no export) is maximally healthy"
THEOREM; void_causes_no_harm; "When all skews equal, TotalExportedHarm = 0"

## 8-TICK ALIGNMENT
DEF; EightTickMisaligned; "pattern.ledger.time % 8 ≠ 0"
DEF; EightTickAligned; "pattern.ledger.time % 8 = 0"
INSIGHT; "Evil patterns tend to be misaligned with fundamental 8-tick rhythm"

## PHYSICS OF EVIL
INSIGHT; imbalance_propagation_is_evil; "PropagatesImbalance ∧ LocallyBounded ∧ energy>0 → IsEvil"
CONNECTION; "Evil has destructively interfering phase in path integral → vanishing amplitude"
THEOREM; evil_cannot_persist_physics; "No stable fixed point in R̂ evolution for parasitic patterns"

## VOXEL SYMMETRY AXIOM (zero-parameter requirement)
# No voxel is distinguished. The ledger dynamics are invariant under translations.
# If any location were "special" (boundary, center, preferred origin), that would
# be unexplained structure — violating the zero-parameter criterion.

## TOPOLOGY OPTIONS UNDER SYMMETRY
# VoxelSymmetry rules out finite carriers with boundary (boundary voxels are special).
# Two symmetry-compatible options remain:
#   1. Infinite carrier (ℤ³): no boundary, no period — default
#   2. Compact quotient (T³ = ℤ³/nℤ³): no boundary, but requires period n

## ZERO-PARAMETER RESOLUTION
# For T³ to be zero-parameter, the period n must be DERIVED from the forcing chain.
# Candidate derivation sources examined:
#   - φ: dimensionless ratio, not a length scale
#   - 8-tick: temporal period, not spatial extent
#   - gap-45: temporal window, not spatial
#   - E_coh: energy scale, not length
# FINDING: No RS structure derives a global spatial period.

@RRF_PRIMER
# Reality Recognition Framework (RRF) - Primer + Glossary (for paper writing)
# Scope: Explanatory. This section is meant to make the RRF pieces of PAPER2_V2/PAPER3_V2 easy to cite in classical scientific prose.
# Claim hygiene: We separate (A) definitions, (B) theorems, (C) models, (D) hypotheses, (E) empirical anchors.
# Note: This file contains mixed RS/RRF material; RRF is the minimal "optimization + invariance" core used for cross-domain (multi-vantage) reasoning.
# Implementation note (repo snapshot 2025-12-19): `IndisputableMonolith.RRF` is a compatibility facade that re-exports the minimal kernel `IndisputableMonolith.OctaveKernel` (see @RRF_LEAN_FORMALIZATION below).

## ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY (EXPOSITORY)
SUMMARY; rrf="RRF is the cross-domain optimization skeleton: an 8-phase 'octave layer' packages a state space, an 8-beat phase clock (Fin 8), a strain/cost functional J, an admissibility/ledger predicate, and an evolution step; optional display channels turn states into observations with scalar quality scores. In this repo snapshot, the Lean implementation is the minimal OctaveKernel (definitions + small witness instances). Stronger 'RRF-style' invariance/transfer theorems (monotone argmin/ranking invariance; octave-equivalence transfer) remain spec targets to be implemented (not currently present as first-class RRF theorems in this Lean tree)."

# RS → QFT Interaction Vertex Bridge | notes/RS_Interaction_Bridge_Note.tex | Internal Science Note
PARADIGM; yukawas_not_ontic="Yukawa couplings are effective parameters, not fundamental in RS"

## The Challenge
QUESTION; "RS predicts mass values; QFT predictions need interaction vertices. How to bridge?"
ANSWER; "Matching procedure at anchor scale μ★ defines effective SM vertices from RS geometric coordinates"

## RS Mechanism for Mass
J_COST_POTENTIAL; formula="J(x) = ½(x + 1/x) - 1"; replaces_mexican_hat
SYMMETRY_BREAKING; mechanism="discrete closure constraints select φ-ladder ratios"
MASS_GENERATION; formula="m_f(μ★) = Yardstick × φ^{r_f - 8 + gap(Z)}"

## The Derived Yukawa
MATCHING_FORMULA; y_f(μ★)="(√2/v) × [Yardstick × φ^{r_f - 8 + gap(Z)}]"
MEANING; "Yukawa is dependent translation parameter, not free fit parameter"
EXAMPLES; [
  "y_e ≈ 2.9×10⁻⁶ is small because electron is at Rung 2",
  "y_t ≈ 0.99 is large because top is at Rung 21"
]

## Geometric Rung → Interaction Vertex Map
MAP; step1="RS Geometric Rung r ∈ ℤ"
MAP; step2="Apply Master Mass Law ⟹ m_RS"
MAP; step3="Output: Vertex strength g_{ff̄H} = i·y_f = i·(m_RS × √2/v)"
CONSEQUENCE; "Standard Feynman diagrams with FIXED matched vertex factors, not free parameters"

## Cross-Section and Decay Rates
EXAMPLE; H_to_ffbar="Γ(H→ff̄) = (N_c G_F m_f²)/(4π√2) × M_H × (1 - 4m_f²/M_H²)^{3/2}"
NOTE; "RS contributes by fixing matched parameters at μ★; SM RG transport provides bookkeeping to M_H"

## Paradigm Shift Summary
MECHANISM; "J-Cost Symmetry Breaking (selecting φ)"
COUPLING; "Derived from Rung (y ∼ φ^r)"
INTERACTION; "Calculated via standard QFT using RS-derived vertices"
INSIGHT; "The parameters in existing equations are fixed geometric integers"
