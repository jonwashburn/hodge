\section*{PROMPT 1 (Pointwise cone identification --- referee concern)}
Let $(X,\omega)$ be a K\"ahler manifold, fix $p$. At a point $x$, define
$C_x \subset \Lambda^{p,p}T^*_xX$ to be the closed convex cone generated by the
``simple calibrated rays'' $\phi_V$ associated to complex $p$-planes
$V \subset T_xX$ (equivalently $i^{p^2}\, v\wedge\bar v$ for decomposable
$v\in\Lambda^{p,0}$).

Prove: $C_x$ equals the classical cone of strongly positive $(p,p)$-forms at $x$.
Give an explicit linear-algebra identification and describe the extreme rays.
Also clarify whether $C_x$ is (or is not) the full PSD cone in
$\mathrm{Herm}(\Lambda^{p,0}T^*_xX)$ when $p>1$.

\section*{PROMPT 2 (Carath\'eodory with uniform finite support + measurability)}
Fix $(n,p)$. For each $x$, let $C_x$ be the strongly positive cone
(or the cone generated by $\phi_V$). Let $\beta$ be a smooth $(p,p)$-form on $X$
with $\beta(x)\in C_x$ for all $x$.

Prove (or disprove): there exists $N=N(n,p)$ and measurable (ideally
piecewise-smooth) choices of complex $p$-planes $V_1(x),\dots,V_N(x)$ and weights
$\lambda_i(x)\ge 0$ such that
\[
\beta(x)=\sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i(x)\, \phi_{V_i(x)}\quad \text{for all }x,
\]
with $\sum_i\lambda_i(x)$ uniformly bounded and with quantitative control of
$x\mapsto(\lambda_i,V_i)$ in terms of $\|\beta\|_{C^1}$ (or Lipschitz on cubes).

\section*{PROMPT 3 (Quantitative relation: calibration deficit vs K\"ahler-angle defect)}
Let $\psi = \omega^{n-p}/(n-p)!$ on a K\"ahler manifold $(X,\omega)$.
For an integral $(2n-2p)$-cycle $T$ with approximate unit tangent
$\xi_T(x)$ defined $|T|$-a.e., define the calibration deficit
\[
\mathrm{Def}_{\mathrm{cal}}(T):=\mathrm{Mass}(T)-\langle [T],[\psi]\rangle
=\int (1-\psi(\xi_T))\, d|T|.
\]
Define a geometric ``K\"ahler-angle'' defect, e.g.
\[
D_{\mathrm{angle}}(T):=\int \mathrm{dist}(\xi_T,\mathrm{Gr}^{\mathrm{cal}})^2\, d|T|,
\]
where $\mathrm{Gr}^{\mathrm{cal}}$ is the calibrated Grassmannian of complex
$(n-p)$-planes.
Prove explicit two-sided inequalities
$\mathrm{Def}_{\mathrm{cal}}(T) \asymp D_{\mathrm{angle}}(T)$ with constants depending only on $(n,p)$.

\section*{PROMPT 4 (Calibrated integral current $\Rightarrow$ analytic cycle)}
Let $(X,\omega,J)$ be a complex manifold with K\"ahler form $\omega$ and
$\psi = \omega^{n-p}/(n-p)!$.
Let $T$ be an integral $(2n-2p)$-cycle calibrated by $\psi$
(i.e.\ $\psi(\xi_T)=1$ $|T|$-a.e.).

Prove: $T$ is a positive closed $(p,p)$-current and in fact equals
$\sum_i m_i [V_i]$ where $V_i$ are irreducible complex analytic subvarieties of
codimension $p$ and $m_i\in\mathbb N$.

(If needed, assume $X$ is compact K\"ahler or projective; give full proof or
precise citations + the missing steps.)

\section*{PROMPT 5 (Projective case: analytic $\Rightarrow$ algebraic and cohomology matching)}
Let $X$ be smooth complex projective. Assume $T$ is a $\psi$-calibrated integral
cycle and hence an analytic cycle.
Prove that each analytic component is algebraic (Chow) and that $\mathrm{PD}([T])$
is a rational Hodge class of type $(p,p)$.
Make the ``therefore $\gamma$ is algebraic'' implication completely explicit.

\section*{PROMPT 6 (Core missing theorem --- ``positive Hodge class $\Rightarrow$ calibrated integral representative'')}
Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective manifold of dimension $n$ with K\"ahler
form $\omega$ and $\psi=\omega^{n-p}/(n-p)!$.
Let $\gamma^+ \in H^{2p}(X,\mathbb Q)\cap H^{p,p}(X)$ be such that it has a smooth
closed representative $\beta$ with $\beta(x)$ in the strongly positive cone for
all $x$.

Prove (or give a counterexample): there exists $m\ge 1$ and an integral
$(2n-2p)$-cycle $T$ with $[T]=\mathrm{PD}(m[\gamma^+])$ and
$\mathrm{Mass}(T)=\langle [T],[\psi]\rangle$ (equivalently $T$ is $\psi$-calibrated).

\section*{PROMPT 7 (Equivalent convex-geometry formulation --- stable norm linearity on an ``effective'' cone)}
Let $\psi$ be a calibration on a compact Riemannian manifold $X$.
Define the stable mass norm
\[
M(h):= \inf\{\mathrm{Mass}(T): T \text{ integral cycle},\ [T]=h\}
\]
on $H_k(X,\mathbb Z)$.
Fix $h$ and define $L(h):=\langle h,[\psi]\rangle$.

Prove: $M(h)=L(h)$ iff there exists a $\psi$-calibrated integral representative of $h$.

Then, for $X$ projective K\"ahler and $\psi=\omega^{n-p}/(n-p)!$, characterize the
cone of classes $h$ for which $M(h)=L(h)$. Is it exactly the cone generated by
complex codimension-$p$ subvarieties?

\section*{PROMPT 8 (Local-to-global realization / microstructure in GMT --- the scaling objection)}
In a coordinate chart $U\subset X$ with approximately constant $\omega$, suppose
you are given a smooth strongly positive closed $(p,p)$-form $\beta$ on $U$
representing an integral cohomology class (after scaling).

Design (or prove impossible): a construction producing an integral
$(2n-2p)$-cycle $T_U$ in $U$ whose mass is controlled by $\int_U \beta\wedge\psi$
(no blow-up), whose boundary errors are controllable on $\partial U$, and whose
homology contribution matches $\mathrm{PD}([\beta|_U])$ in relative homology.
Give explicit quantitative bounds and explain how to glue across a cube
decomposition to get a global closed integral cycle.

In particular, a robust formulation of the gluing step is to target a \emph{flat norm} estimate for the boundary mismatch:
for a cubulation of mesh $\mathrm{mesh}\to 0$ and a raw sum of local sheet-stacks $T^{\mathrm{raw}}=\sum_Q S_Q$,
prove (or refute) that
\[
\mathcal F(\partial T^{\mathrm{raw}})\ \xrightarrow[\delta,\varepsilon\to 0,\ \mathrm{mesh}\to 0,\ m\to\infty]{}\ 0,
\]
equivalently that for all smooth test forms $\eta$ with $\|\eta\|_{\mathrm{comass}},\|d\eta\|_{\mathrm{comass}}\le 1$ one has
$|\partial T^{\mathrm{raw}}(\eta)|\le o(1)$.

Optional hint: in a flat chart, stacks of (nearly) parallel sheets can be parameterized by transverse translations.
One can then try to control face mismatches in flat norm by controlling a transport distance (e.g.\ $W_1$) between the induced transverse measures on neighboring cubes.

\section*{PROMPT 9 (Signed decomposition positivity lemma --- quantitative and pointwise)}
Let $\gamma_{\mathrm{harm}}$ be the harmonic representative of a rational $(p,p)$
class $\gamma$ on a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X,\omega)$.
Prove: there exists an explicit $N$ (depending on $\|\gamma_{\mathrm{harm}}\|_{C^0}$
and $\omega$) such that the smooth closed form
\[
\beta:=\gamma_{\mathrm{harm}} + N\, \omega^p
\]
is strongly positive pointwise.
State the sharp cone notion (weak/strong positivity) and prove the uniform-in-$x$ choice of $N$.

\section*{PROMPT 10 (Reality check / falsification)}
Find (or prove none exists): a smooth complex projective $X$ and a rational Hodge
class $\alpha\in H^{2p}(X,\mathbb Q)\cap H^{p,p}(X)$ that admits a smooth closed
strongly positive representative, but such that no positive rational combination
of codimension-$p$ algebraic cycles represents $\alpha$ (equivalently, $\alpha$ is
not in the algebraic effective cone).
If you believe it’s impossible, explain which known conjecture/theorem it would imply.
