# Axiom Lock File for hodge_conjecture' Proof Track
# =================================================
#
# This file documents the EXPECTED axiom dependencies for the main theorem.
# Any deviation from this list should fail CI.

# Last verified: 2026-01-10

[ALLOWED_AXIOMS]
propext
Classical.choice
Quot.sound

[KNOWN_ISSUES]
# These are tracked and expected to be resolved:
sorryAx  # From sorry statements in LeibnizRule.lean (Agent 1 working on this)

[FORBIDDEN]
# Any axiom NOT in ALLOWED_AXIOMS or KNOWN_ISSUES should FAIL the build.
# Examples of axioms that were previously present and removed:
# - Current.boundary_bound (eliminated 2026-01-12, now a field on Current structure)
# - FundamentalClassSet_represents_class (eliminated 2026-01-12)
# - smoothExtDeriv_comass_bound (eliminated 2026-01-12, was mathematically FALSE)

[VERIFICATION_COMMAND]
# Run this to verify the current axiom state:
# lake env lean Hodge/Utils/DependencyCheck.lean
# 
# Or run the full verification script:
# ./scripts/verify_proof_track.sh
