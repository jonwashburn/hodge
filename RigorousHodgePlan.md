# Rigorous Formalization Plan: Hodge Conjecture

**Goal:** Machine-verified proof with **zero** `sorry`, `admit`, or `axiom` statements.

**Current Status:** 58 sorries across 17 files ⚠️ Quality audit in progress

## 🔴🔴🔴 CRITICAL WARNING: FAKE PROOFS DETECTED 🔴🔴🔴

**WE FOUND AGENTS REMOVING `sorry` BY MAKING DEFINITIONS TRIVIALLY TRUE.**

### Example of what NOT to do (from SerreVanishing.lean):
```lean
-- ❌ WRONG: Defining cohomology as Unit makes everything trivially zero
def SheafCohomology (_F : CoherentSheaf n X) (_q : ℕ) : Type := Unit

-- ❌ WRONG: This "proves" nothing - it just shows Unit ≃ Unit  
theorem serre_vanishing ... : isZero (SheafCohomology ...) := ⟨Equiv.refl Unit⟩
```

### This is CHEATING. The file compiles but proves NOTHING.

**Before you write ANY code, ask yourself:**
1. Does my definition have actual mathematical content?
2. Could my proof be trivially true because I made the types empty/unit?
3. Am I actually proving the theorem, or just making Lean happy?

**If you can't prove something properly:**
- Use `sorry` with a comment explaining the gap
- Or use `axiom` with full documentation
- **DO NOT** fake it with `Unit` types or `True` propositions

## 🚨🚨🚨 STOP! READ YOUR TRACK ASSIGNMENT FIRST 🚨🚨🚨

**YOU MAY ONLY EDIT THE FILES ASSIGNED TO YOUR TRACK. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

| If you are... | You may ONLY edit these files | DO NOT TOUCH |
|---------------|------------------------------|--------------|
| **Track A1** | `Classical/SerreVanishing.lean` | Everything else |
| **Track A2** | `Classical/Bergman.lean` | Everything else |
| **Track A3** | `Classical/GAGA.lean`, `Classical/FedererFleming.lean` | Everything else |

### ❌ IF YOU SEE AN ERROR IN ANOTHER FILE:
- **DO NOT FIX IT** — that's another agent's job
- **DO NOT EDIT IT** — you will create merge conflicts
- **ONLY WORK ON YOUR ASSIGNED FILES**

### ❌ THESE FILES ARE OFF-LIMITS TO EVERYONE:
`Basic.lean`, `Main.lean`, `Kahler/Main.lean`, `HarveyLawson.lean`, `Lefschetz.lean`, `IntegralCurrents.lean`, `Forms.lean`, `Currents.lean`, `FlatNorm.lean`, `Manifolds.lean`, `SignedDecomp.lean`

## ⚠️ PROOF QUALITY STANDARDS

**This is a quality proof, not a checkbox exercise.** Every definition and theorem must be mathematically meaningful.

### Absolutely Forbidden:
- ❌ **Vacuous definitions** like `def X := sorry` or `def X : Type* := Unit`
- ❌ **Trivial propositions** like `theorem foo : True := trivial`
- ❌ **Placeholder fields** like `is_something : Prop := True`
- ❌ **Empty structures** that compile but prove nothing
- ❌ **Circular reasoning** or assuming what you're trying to prove
- ❌ **Rushing to remove `sorry`** without understanding the mathematics
- ❌ **`Classical.choice sorry`** — this is just `sorry` with extra steps
- ❌ **Defining types as `Unit` then proving `Unit ≃ Unit`** — this proves nothing

### Required:
- ✅ **Every definition must have mathematical content** — if you define `SheafCohomology`, it must actually be sheaf cohomology (derived functors), not a placeholder type
- ✅ **Every theorem must have a real proof** — the proof term must actually establish the statement, not just make Lean happy
- ✅ **Consult references** — these are deep theorems (Harvey-Lawson, GAGA, Federer-Fleming); read the cited papers if needed
- ✅ **Ask for help** if a proof is beyond current Mathlib — it's better to document a genuine gap than fake a proof
- ✅ **Preserve mathematical intent** — the LaTeX manuscript `Hodge-v6-w-Jon-Update-MERGED.tex` contains the intended arguments

### Quality Check:
Before claiming a `sorry` is resolved, ask yourself:
1. Does this definition/proof actually mean what the docstring says?
2. Would a mathematician reading this accept it as rigorous?
3. Is there any way this could be vacuously true or trivially satisfied?

## 🔒 PHASE 2 (After Tracks A1-A5 Complete)

These files have heavy dependencies — only work on them after above tracks are done:

| File | Sorries | Reason to defer |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `Basic.lean` | 3 | Imported everywhere — edits cause full rebuild |
| `Kahler/Main.lean` | 8 | Imports all of Kahler/ and Classical/ |
| `Main.lean` | 5 | Final assembly — imports everything |
| `Classical/HarveyLawson.lean` | 3 | Imports Analytic/ |
| `Classical/Lefschetz.lean` | 2 | Imports Kahler/ |

---

## 📋 BUILD POLICY

1. **Never run `lake build` without arguments** — it rebuilds everything
2. **Use specific module builds:** `lake build Hodge.Classical.GAGA`
3. **Commit frequently, push at session end**
4. **If build fails on imports:** another agent may have broken something — coordinate

---

## 🎯 Milestone Targets

- **M1:** ✅ Structural Assembly Complete
- **M2:** Tracks A1-A5 complete (56 sorries → 0)
- **M3:** Phase 2 complete (21 sorries → 0)
- **M4:** Verified State — **zero** `sorry`, `axiom`, `admit`
