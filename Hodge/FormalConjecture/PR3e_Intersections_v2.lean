PR 3e (revised API): From `IsNOpposed` + finiteness to off-diagonal intersection vanishing
(Deligne, *Théorie de Hodge II*, Proposition (1.2.5)(i), first half).

Assumptions:
* `C` is an abelian category.
* `F, G` are decreasing `ℤ`-filtrations (`Filtration.DecFiltration`) on an object `X`.
* both filtrations are finite (Deligne (1.1.4)).
* `F` and `G` are `n`-opposed in the sense of Deligne (1.2.3), expressed via the Zassenhaus
  quotient `gr₂` (defined as a cokernel).

Conclusion:
* for all `p q` with `p+q>n`, we have `F^p ∩ G^q = 0` as subobjects of `X`.

This is the descending-induction argument in Deligne's proof.

No axioms, no placeholders, no `sorry`.
