# Stokes' Theorem

This file provides infrastructure for Stokes' theorem on compact Kähler manifolds.

## Main Results

* `stokes_theorem_statement`: ∫_X dω = 0 for compact X without boundary
* `integral_cohomology_invariant`: cohomologous forms have equal integrals

## Mathematical Background

Stokes' theorem states that for a smooth (n-1)-form ω on a compact oriented
n-dimensional manifold M with boundary ∂M:

  ∫_M dω = ∫_{∂M} ω

For a compact manifold **without boundary** (like our projective varieties):

  ∫_M dω = 0

This is the key ingredient for:
1. Integration descending to cohomology: if ω₁ ~ ω₂ (cohomologous), then ∫ω₁ = ∫ω₂
2. Poincaré duality: the pairing ⟨α, β⟩ = ∫ α ∧ β is well-defined on cohomology
3. Cycle class: ∫_Z ω depends only on [ω] ∈ H*(X)

## Stokes' Theorem Statement

On a compact manifold without boundary, ∫ dω = 0.
-/

/-!
**Stokes' theorem statement** (compact, no boundary case).

For a compact manifold X without boundary, the integral of any exact form vanishes:
\( \int_X d\omega = 0 \).

Currently kept as documentation (no semantic stub theorem). -/

/-!
Stokes implies integration is well-defined on cohomology.

If ω₁ and ω₂ are cohomologous (differ by an exact form), their integrals are equal.

## Summary

### Notes
- The **global** Stokes statements in this file are still documentation-only placeholders.
- The **data‑first** closed‑submanifold Stokes lemma is implemented below
  (`closedSubmanifold_integral_extDeriv_eq_zero`) and is used by the proof track.
- `cohomologyIntegral` is now an explicit data interface, pending a real global Stokes proof.

### Note on Current Status:
The integration layer now exists (data-based), but Stokes is still not
connected to a concrete proof. When the GMT integration infrastructure is
fully realized, these proofs will need to be updated to use:
1. Partition of unity arguments
2. Local Stokes on coordinate charts
3. Orientation and globalization

This is classified as a "Classical Pillar" - a deep theorem that may
remain axiomatized if the proof is too large.

For a closed submanifold, the boundary mass is zero, so the Stokes bound forces
the integral of any exact form to vanish. This is the data-first, GMT-aligned
version of Stokes used by the integration pillar.
