This file defines the flat norm on currents and proves its basic properties.
The flat norm is the natural metric for the space of integral currents.

Since `Current` operations are opaque, most properties are axiomatized.

/-- **The Flat Norm** (Federer-Fleming, 1960).
    The flat norm of a current T is the infimum of M(S) + M(V) such that T = S + ∂V.
