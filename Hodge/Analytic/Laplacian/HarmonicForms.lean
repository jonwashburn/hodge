# Harmonic forms (skeleton / off proof track)

This file introduces a lightweight interface for *harmonic forms*:

- A `k`-form `ω` is harmonic if `Δω = 0`.

With the current placeholder Laplacian (zero operator), every form is harmonic. This is **not**
mathematically meaningful, but it provides a stable API that can be upgraded once the Hodge star
and codifferential are implemented nontrivially.

This module is **off proof track** unless explicitly imported.

/-- **Harmonic characterization (stub)**.

In full Hodge theory one proves `Δω = 0 ↔ (dω = 0 ∧ δω = 0)` using the L² inner product.

In our current architecture, `⋆` is wired via `HodgeStarData.fromFiber` but is still **degenerate**
(nonzero only in middle degree at the fiber level). As a result, `δ` and hence `Δ = dδ + δd`
still simplify to `0` for all ω, and this lemma records the resulting *formal* characterization
that is stable under future upgrades. -/
