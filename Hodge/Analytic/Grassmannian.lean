/-- The calibrated Grassmannian G_p(x): the set of complex p-planes in T_x X. -/
def CalibratedGrassmannian (p : ℕ) (x : X) : Set (Submodule ℂ (TangentSpace (𝓒_complex n) x)) :=
  { V | Module.finrank ℂ V = p }

/-! ## Simple Calibrated Forms -/

/-- Axiom: Existence of simple calibrated forms.
For each complex p-plane V at x, there exists a simple (p,p)-form
which is the volume form of V restricted to that plane.
This is defined via the exterior product of orthonormal dual vectors.
Reference: Section 3 of the manuscript. -/
axiom simpleCalibratedForm_raw (p : ℕ) (x : X) (V : Submodule ℂ (TangentSpace (𝓒_complex n) x)) :
    (TangentSpace (𝓒_complex n) x) [⋀^Fin (2 * p)]→ₗ[ℂ] ℂ

/-- The simple calibrated (p,p)-form supported at point x, associated to a complex p-plane V.
This is the volume form of V extended by zero outside V.
Reference: Section 3 of the manuscript. -/
def simpleCalibratedForm (p : ℕ) (x : X) (V : Submodule ℂ (TangentSpace (𝓒_complex n) x)) :
    SmoothForm n X (2 * p) :=
  { as_alternating := fun x' =>
      if _ : x' = x then simpleCalibratedForm_raw p x V
      else 0 }

/-- The set of all simple calibrated (p,p)-forms at a point x. -/
def simpleCalibratedForms (p : ℕ) (x : X) : Set (SmoothForm n X (2 * p)) :=
  { ξ | ∃ (V : Submodule ℂ (TangentSpace (𝓒_complex n) x)),
    Module.finrank ℂ V = p ∧ ξ = simpleCalibratedForm p x V }

/-! ## Calibrated Cone -/

/-- The calibrated cone C_x at x is the closed convex cone generated by
the simple calibrated forms.
Reference: Section 3 of the manuscript. -/
def calibratedCone (p : ℕ) (x : X) : Set (SmoothForm n X (2 * p)) :=
  closure ((ConvexCone.hull ℝ (simpleCalibratedForms p x)).carrier)

/-- The calibrated cone is closed.
Proof: By definition, calibratedCone is the closure of the convex hull,
and closure of any set is closed. -/
theorem calibratedCone_is_closed (p : ℕ) (x : X) :
    IsClosed (calibratedCone (n := n) p x) :=

/-! ## Cone Distance and Defect -/

/-- The pointwise distance from a form α to the calibrated cone at x. -/
def distToCone (p : ℕ) (α : SmoothForm n X (2 * p)) (x : X) : ℝ :=
  Metric.infDist α (calibratedCone p x)

/-- Axiom: The global cone defect Def_cone(α).
This is the L2-integral of the pointwise distance to the calibrated cone:
  Def_cone(α) = (∫_X (distToCone p α x)² dVol)^(1/2)
It measures how far a form is from being in the calibrated cone globally. -/
axiom coneDefect (p : ℕ) (α : SmoothForm n X (2 * p)) : ℝ

/-- Axiom: Cone defect is non-negative. -/
axiom coneDefect_nonneg (p : ℕ) (α : SmoothForm n X (2 * p)) : coneDefect p α ≥ 0

/-! ## Projection Theorems -/

/-- Axiom: Radial Minimization.
The pointwise distance to a calibrated ray is achieved by orthogonal projection.
For unit ξ, ‖α - λξ‖² is minimized at λ* = max(0, ⟨α, ξ⟩).
Proof: Standard result on projection onto a ray in an inner product space.
Reference: Lemma 3.1 in manuscript. -/
axiom radial_minimization (x : X) (ξ : SmoothForm n X (2 * p)) (α : SmoothForm n X (2 * p)) :
    pointwiseNorm ξ x = 1 →
    ∃ lam_star : ℝ, lam_star = max 0 (pointwiseInner α ξ x) ∧
    ∀ l ≥ (0 : ℝ), (pointwiseNorm (α - lam_star • ξ) x)^2 ≤ (pointwiseNorm (α - l • ξ) x)^2

/-- Axiom: Pointwise Calibration Distance Formula.
The distance² to the calibrated cone equals ‖α‖² minus the maximum pairing squared:
  dist²(α, C_x) = ‖α‖² - (sup_{ξ ∈ simple} max(0, ⟨α, ξ⟩))²
Reference: Equation (3.1) in manuscript. -/
axiom dist_cone_sq_formula (p : ℕ) (α : SmoothForm n X (2 * p)) (x : X) :
    (distToCone p α x)^2 = (pointwiseNorm α x)^2 -
      (sSup { r | ∃ ξ ∈ simpleCalibratedForms p x, r = max 0 (pointwiseInner α ξ x) })^2

/-! ## Constants -/

/-- The cone-to-net comparison constant K = (11/9)².
This constant appears in the comparison between cone defect and net approximation.
Reference: Section 3 of manuscript. -/
def coneToNetConstant : ℝ := (11 / 9 : ℝ)^2

/-- The cone-to-net constant is positive. -/
theorem coneToNetConstant_pos : coneToNetConstant > 0 := by
