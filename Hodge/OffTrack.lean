# `Hodge.OffTrack` (Siloed Modules)

This module collects **off-proof-track** work: additional infrastructure and classical
results that are *not* required to compile the main theorem in `Hodge.Main`.

It is safe for these files to contain `sorry` and/or additional axioms while the main
proof track is being certified.

See `docs/SILO_MODULES.md` for the current inventory.
