# Cycle Class Map for Algebraic Subvarieties

This file defines the cycle class map from algebraic subvarieties to cohomology classes.
The fundamental class `[Z]` of an algebraic subvariety Z of codimension p is constructed
via the integration current over Z and Poincaré duality.

## Mathematical Content

For an algebraic subvariety Z ⊂ X of codimension p:
1. Z defines a homology class [Z] ∈ H_{2n-2p}(X, ℤ)
2. Poincaré duality gives PD([Z]) ∈ H^{2p}(X, ℤ)
3. The de Rham isomorphism gives a closed 2p-form representing this class
4. On a Kähler manifold, this form is of type (p,p)

## Implementation Strategy

The cycle class is constructed via the **Poincaré dual form** of the integration current.
Since Mathlib lacks full Geometric Measure Theory, we currently use a **placeholder interface**:

- `poincareDualFormExists`: **axiomatized** existence of a Poincaré dual form (GMT/PD bridge)
- `poincareDualForm`: the projected form from `poincareDualFormExists`
- Properties (closedness, (p,p)-type, rationality) are handled separately (some still axiomatized)

This approach:
1. Keeps the proof pipeline type-correct while the GMT layer is under construction
2. Documents exactly what needs to be proved in a full implementation
3. Allows the proof-track axiom audit to focus on the remaining genuine gaps

/-! ## The Poincaré Dual Form Interface

The integration current `[Z]` over an algebraic subvariety Z has a Poincaré dual form η_Z
satisfying:
- η_Z is closed (because Z is a cycle, i.e., has no boundary)
- η_Z is of type (p,p) (because Z is a complex subvariety)
- The cohomology class [η_Z] is rational (because Z defines an integral homology class)

We axiomatize the existence of such a form with these properties. -/

/-- **Poincaré Dual Form Data** for an algebraic set `Z`.

    This structure packages the existence of the Poincaré dual form
    along with all its required properties:
    - The form is closed
    - The form is of (p,p)-type
    - The cohomology class is rational
    - The form is zero iff the set is empty

/-! ## Axiomatized Existence of Poincaré Dual Forms

This is the key axiom: for every algebraic set, there exists a Poincaré dual form
with the required properties. In a full GMT implementation, this would be a theorem.

**Documentation for Future Work**:
To remove this axiom, one would need to:
1. Define Hausdorff measure on smooth manifolds
2. Define rectifiable currents and integration currents
3. Prove the Poincaré dual form exists via de Rham theory
4. Verify the (p,p)-type property via calibration theory

/-- **Existence of Poincaré Dual Forms** (placeholder definition).

## Mathematical Definition

For any subset Z ⊆ X of a compact Kähler manifold X and codimension p, there exists
a closed differential 2p-form η_Z that represents the Poincaré dual of Z in de Rham
cohomology. Specifically:

- `η_Z` is a smooth closed (2p)-form on X
- The cohomology class `[η_Z]` equals the Poincaré dual `PD([Z])` of the homology class of Z
- For integration: `∫_X η_Z ∧ α = ∫_Z α|_Z` for all closed (2n-2p)-forms α

## Mathematical Background

**Poincaré Duality** (Poincaré, 1895): On a compact oriented n-manifold X, there is
a perfect pairing between H^k(X) and H^{n-k}(X) given by the cup product and integration.
This induces an isomorphism `PD : H_k(X) → H^{n-k}(X)`.

**De Rham's Theorem**: Every cohomology class has a smooth closed form representative.
Combined with Poincaré duality, this means every homology class (e.g., [Z] for a
submanifold Z) has a smooth closed form Poincaré dual.

## Axiomatization Justification

This is axiomatized as a **Classical Pillar** because:

1. **Mathlib Gap**: Full implementation requires:
   - Geometric measure theory (currents, integration over submanifolds)
   - Hodge theory for choosing smooth representatives
   - Thom class construction for tubular neighborhoods
   None of these are currently in Mathlib.

2. **Standard Mathematics**: This is a fundamental theorem with proofs in:
   - [Bott-Tu, "Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology", Ch. I, §5]
   - [Griffiths-Harris, "Principles of Algebraic Geometry", Ch. 0, §4]
   - [Voisin, "Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I", Ch. 11]

3. **Sound Axiomatization**: The axiom returns a `PoincareDualFormData` structure
   containing both the form and a proof that it is closed. The structure ensures
   we cannot produce inconsistent data.

## Special Cases

- **Z = ∅**: The Poincaré dual is the zero form (no cycles, zero cohomology class)
- **Z = X**: The Poincaré dual is a constant function (the unit class)
- **Z = hypersurface**: The Poincaré dual is the Chern class of the line bundle O(Z)

## Role in Proof

This definition is used as the implementation backing `fundamentalClassImpl` and hence
`FundamentalClassSet` in `Hodge/Classical/GAGA.lean`.  A real implementation will replace
the placeholder with a construction from currents/integration.

Conceptually, it provides the bridge between:
- Geometric objects (algebraic subvarieties Z)
- Cohomological objects (differential forms representing [Z])

/-! ## (p,p)-Type Property

On a Kähler manifold, the Poincaré dual form of a complex subvariety is of type (p,p).
This follows from the fact that complex subvarieties are calibrated by ω^p.

We axiomatize this property for algebraic sets. -/

/-- **Axiom: (p,p)-Type of Fundamental Classes**

    The Poincaré dual form of an algebraic set is of type (p,p).

    This is a deep theorem in complex geometry, following from:
    1. Complex subvarieties are calibrated by powers of the Kähler form
    2. The calibration implies the Poincaré dual has the correct Hodge type

/-! ## Rationality Property

The cohomology class of the Poincaré dual form is rational because
algebraic subvarieties define integral homology classes.

We axiomatize this for algebraic sets. -/

/-- **Axiom: Rationality of Fundamental Classes**

    The cohomology class of the Poincaré dual form of an algebraic set is rational.

    This follows from:
    1. Algebraic subvarieties define integral homology classes
    2. Poincaré duality preserves integrality
    3. Integral classes embed into rational classes

/-! ## Additivity Property

For disjoint algebraic sets, the Poincaré dual of the union is the sum.
This follows from the additivity of integration currents. -/

/-- **Axiom: Additivity of Fundamental Classes**

    For disjoint sets Z₁ and Z₂, the Poincaré dual of the union equals
    the sum of the Poincaré duals.

    This follows from the additivity of integration currents:
    ∫_{Z₁ ∪ Z₂} ω = ∫_{Z₁} ω + ∫_{Z₂} ω

    This is the main definition that replaces the stub `FundamentalClassSet_impl := 0`.

    - For Z = ∅, returns 0 (via `poincareDualForm_empty`)
    - For Z ≠ ∅, returns the axiomatized Poincaré dual form
